# Blackmagic Ascend: A Terminal based text editor
Blackmagic Ascend (bm-ascend in short) is a powerful terminal-based text editor that offers syntax highlighting and efficient text search capabilities. 
With Ascend, you can conveniently edit and manipulate text files right from your command line interface.


## Features
1. Syntax Highlighting: Ascend provides syntax highlighting for various programming languages, making it easier to read and understand code. The editor dynamically highlights different elements such as keywords, comments, and strings, improving code readability.
2. Linear and Incremental Text Search: Ascend allows you to search for specific text within your files. You can perform both linear searches, which find exact matches in the entire file, as well as incremental searches that display results in real-time as you type. This feature enables quick and efficient navigation within large text files.
